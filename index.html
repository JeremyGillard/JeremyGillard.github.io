                <h2>Bachelor's degree<br>Computer science and systems,<br>network and telecommunications<br>(Student)</h2>
                <p><span class="keyword">Java</span>, <span class="keyword">Python</span> and <span class="keyword">C++</span> are the three languages I've been practicing for the last five years. 
                    I also learned in depth about the standard, embedded and real-time operating systems as well as tcp/ip network bases. 
                    The end of my curriculum was finally more oriented towards <span class="keyword">data science</span> and the new algorithmic techniques of <span class="keyword">artificial intelligence</span> (Machine learning and Deep learning).</p>
